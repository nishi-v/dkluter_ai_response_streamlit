# D'Kluter Response Generation using AI

## Description
This project utilizes Gemini-2.0-Flash and Google Search to analyze a given image and its associated types. It generates structured metadata, including a title, description, tags, and detailed fields for detected objects.

Batch responses can also be generated by providing a CSV file with multiple images and their corresponding types.

Some sample images and a CSV file with results are also provided for reference.

## How to Use:
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-ML-Team-FS/dkluter_ai_response.git
cd dkluter_ai_response/
```

### Step 2: Initialize virtual environment
#### Option 1: Using Poetry
1. Install poetry if not already present:
```bash
pip install poetry 
```

2. Ensure that the virtual environment is created in the root directory:
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

3. Initialize virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

4. Install the required packages:
```bash
poetry install
```


#### Option 2: Using requirements.txt
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages using requirements file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Generate and save Gemini API Key
1. Generate an API Key from Google AI Studio:
- link: [API key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Save the generated API key in .env file in root directory:

    A. Create .env file in the root folder.

    B. Add API Key in .env file:
    - GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIza...4CpSE"

### Step 4: Save the images in desired folder
Add all images you want to generate the response for in the asset_images folder.

Note: Sample images are present in asset_images folder.


### Step 5: Create a csv file
Create a CSV file in desired format and save it in csv_files folder. 
Ensure the CSV file follows this structure. The columns for Title, Description, Tags, Fields, Time, and JSON Response can be left emptyâ€”these will be automatically filled by the script.

| S.No. | Image | Types | Title | Description | Tags | Fields | Time | Json Response |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | img_name_1.jpg | type_1_1, type_1_2 | | | | | | |
| 2 | img_name_1.jpg | type_2_1, type_2_2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | img_name_1.jpg | type_3_1, type_3_2 | | | | | | |

Note: 
1. Sample CSV files with responses is present in csv_files
    - For batch processing input csv file -> output csv file.
    
    Example: Items_List.csv, list_2.csv

    - For single image file, input image name and type of object -> output csv file. WIll be saved in above format.

    Example: output_00001.csv


## Step 6: Run the python script
There are 4 arguments that you can pass with the python script-
1. -f : Use this to pass the name of the csv file for which you want to generate responses.
2. -t : Use this if you want the token_count generated for the csv file.
3. -i : Use this if you want to generate the response with single image. ALso pass -T argument with it for types of that particular image.
4. -T : Use this if you want to generate the single image response pass with argument (-i). And use it alone if you just want to generate token counts for a certain type of object, make sure to just add the types with argument.

Usage:
- If Batch Responses are required for input CSV File
```bash
python3 main.py -f data.csv
```

- If batch Responses and token count is required for input csv file
```bash
python3 main.py -f data.csv -t
```

- If just token count is required and no response required for the prompt 
```bash
python3 main.py -T "type_1, type_2, type_3"
```

- If Single Image Response is required with token count
```bash
python3 main.py -i "img.jpg" -T "type_1, type_2, type_3" -t
```

- If Single Image Response is required without token count 
```bash
python3 main.py -i "img.jpg" -T "type_1, type_2, type_3"
```

Note:
1. If batch input in CSV format is given, then output will be stored in that CSV file only with a SUMMARY row at the end.

| SUMMARY | Total Images | Successfully Processed | Failed | Total Time | Average Time per Image |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|

2. If single image and corresponding type is provided then an automatic new output_8.csv file will be saved in csv_files folder with the response.

## General JSON Format of Response for an Input
- Input given by User:
    - image = image.jpg (jpg, jpeg, or png Format)
    - types = "type_1", "type_2"

- Response Structure - JSON Format:
```json
{
    "Data": {
        "title": "Appropriate Title",
        "description": "A brief description providing relevant details about their characteristics, actions, or context while ignoring the background.",
        "tags": [
            "tag_1",
            "tag_2",
            "tag_3"
        ],
        "fields": [
            {
                "field_name": "Field_1",
                "field_type": "NUMBER",
                "field_value": ["12345"]
            },
            {
                "field_name": "Field_2",
                "field_type": "TEXT",
                "field_value": ["Value"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
### Explanation of Response Field: 
- Title: The AI-generated title for the image based on detected objects and context.
- Description: A concise AI-generated description summarizing the content of the image.
- Tags: A list of relevant keywords describing the image, starting from broad categories and moving to specific attributes.
- Fields: Structured metadata fields that provide additional details about detected objects.
    - Field Name: Name of the detected field (e.g., "Product ID", "Location").
    - Field Type: Type of data stored in the field (NUMBER, TEXT, DATE, or LOCATION).
    - Field Value: The corresponding value(s) for the field.

### Response Limitations:

| Field | Limitation |

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues
1. API Key not working
- Ensure the API key is correctly saved in the .env file.
- Verify that the key is active and has the necessary permissions in Google AI Studio.

2. Module Not Found Error
- Ensure dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
poetry install  # If using Poetry
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using requirements.txt
```

3. CSV File Not Updating
- Ensure the CSV file is properly formatted as per the given structure.
- Check if the script has necessary write permissions for the file.
