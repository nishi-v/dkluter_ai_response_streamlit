# D'Kluter Response Generation using AI

## Description
This project utilizes Gemini-2.0-Flash and Google Search to analyze a given image and its associated types. It generates structured metadata, including a title, description, tags, and detailed fields for detected objects.

Batch responses can also be generated by providing a CSV file with multiple images and their corresponding types.

Some sample images and a CSV file with results are also provided for reference.

## How to Use:
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-ML-Team-FS/dkluter_ai_response.git
cd dkluter_ai_response/
```

### Step 2: Initialize virtual environment
#### Option 1: Using Poetry
1. Install poetry if not already present:
```bash
pip install poetry 
```

2. Ensure that the virtual environment is created in the root directory:
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

3. Initialize virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

4. Install the required packages:
```bash
poetry install
```


#### Option 2: Using requirements.txt
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages using requirements file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Generate and save Gemini API Key
1. Generate an API Key from Google AI Studio:
- link: [API key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Save the generated API key in .env file in root directory:

    A. Create .env file in the root folder.

    B. Add API Key in .env file:
    - GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIza...4CpSE"

### Step 4: Save the images in desired folder
Add all images you want to generate the response for in the asset_images folder.

Note: Sample images are present in asset_images folder.


### Step 5: Create a csv file
Create a CSV file in desired format and save it in root folder. 
Ensure the CSV file follows this structure. The columns for Title, Description, Tags, Fields, Time, and JSON Response can be left emptyâ€”these will be automatically filled by the script.

| S.No. | Image | Types | Title | Description | Tags | Fields | Time | Json Response |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | img_name_1.jpg | type_1_1, type_1_2 | | | | | | |
| 2 | img_name_1.jpg | type_2_1, type_2_2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | img_name_1.jpg | type_3_1, type_3_2 | | | | | | |

Note: Sample CSV file with responses is present in root folder - Items_List.csv.

## Step 6: Run the python script
Run the python script by passing your csv file name. For example-
- python3 main.py data.csv

This will start generating the responses for all the images and corresponding types and at last will store back the results in the desired place in the same data.csv file you passed.

## General Format of Response for an Input
- Input given by User:
image = image.jpg (jpg, jpeg, or png Format)

types = "type_1", "type_2"

- Response Structure - JSON Format:
```json
{
    "Data": {
        "title": "Appropriate Title",
        "description": "A brief description providing relevant details about their characteristics, actions, or context while ignoring the background.",
        "tags": [
            "tag_1",
            "tag_2",
            "tag_3"
        ],
        "fields": [
            {
                "field_name": "Field_1",
                "field_type": "NUMBER",
                "field_value": ["12345"]
            },
            {
                "field_name": "Field_2",
                "field_type": "TEXT",
                "field_value": ["Value"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
### Explanation of Response Field: 
- Title: The AI-generated title for the image based on detected objects and context.
- Description: A concise AI-generated description summarizing the content of the image.
- Tags: A list of relevant keywords describing the image, starting from broad categories and moving to specific attributes.
- Fields: Structured metadata fields that provide additional details about detected objects.
    - Field Name: Name of the detected field (e.g., "Product ID", "Location").
    - Field Type: Type of data stored in the field (NUMBER, TEXT, DATE, or LOCATION).
    - Field Value: The corresponding value(s) for the field.

### Response Limitations:

| Field | Limitation |
|----------|----------|
| Title | Max 100 characters |
| Description | Max 80 words |
| Tags | Max 50 characters |
| Field Name | Max 50 characters | 
| Field Type | Must be one of: NUMBER, TEXT, DATE, LOCATION |
| Field Value | Max 500 characters |


## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues
1. API Key not working
- Ensure the API key is correctly saved in the .env file.
- Verify that the key is active and has the necessary permissions in Google AI Studio.

2. Module Not Found Error
- Ensure dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
poetry install  # If using Poetry
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using requirements.txt
```

3. CSV File Not Updating
- Ensure the CSV file is properly formatted as per the given structure.
- Check if the script has necessary write permissions for the file.
